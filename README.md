# Hello, I'm Zo 👋🏾
## About Me 🚀
I'm a passionate Web3 Developer, diving deeper into the world of smart contract security research to contribute toward building safer and more reliable decentralized applications. My journey in auditing smart contracts is still at the beginner level, but I'm determined to grow this into a comprehensive, professional portfolio.

## Skills 💼
- **Languages**: Solidity
- **Frameworks/Tools**: Foundry, Remix
- **Testing & Security Tools**: Slither, Echidna, Aderyn

## Current Learning Path 🌱
I am intensively learning about:
- Security patterns in smart contract design
- Common vulnerabilities and exploits in smart contracts
- Advanced testing techniques for decentralized applications

## Projects 🛠️
Here’s a brief overview of some projects I've developed:
- **ERC20 Token**: A fully functional token adhering to the ERC20 standard.
- **Fund-Me Fundraiser Contract**: A decentralized platform for fundraising, leveraging smart contracts for transparent and secure transactions.
- **Smart Contract Lottery**: A decentralized lottery system implemented using Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Mood NFT**: A unique NFT project where users can mint NFTs reflecting their mood.
- **DeFi Stablecoin**: A stablecoin system designed to maintain a stable value through algorithmic mechanisms.
- **Simple DAO**: A basic decentralized autonomous organization allowing token holders to vote on community proposals.

## Smart Contract Audits 🔍
This portfolio will feature my audits of smart contracts, starting at a beginner level but evolving into a professional showcase.

1. **[Audit #1: PasswordStore]**
   - **Summary:** This audit highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the PasswordStore contract, including:
     - **[H-1]** Storing the password on-chain without encryption makes it visible to anyone.
     - **[H-2]** Lack of access control on the `setPassword` function allows any user to change the stored password.
     - **[I-1]** Incorrect natspec comment in the `getPassword` function signature.

   - **Impact & Mitigations:** 
     - **Severity:** High (for H-1 and H-2)
     - **Mitigations:** Implement encryption, add access controls, and correct documentation.

More audits will be added as I continue my journey toward mastering smart contract security.
