# Hello, I'm Zo 👋🏾
## About Me 🚀
I am a passionate Web3 Developer specializing in smart contract security research, dedicated to enhancing the security and reliability of decentralized applications. With a solid foundation in smart contract auditing, I am actively expanding my expertise to include comprehensive, high-level security analysis and mitigation strategies.

## Skills 💼
- **Languages**: Solidity
- **Frameworks/Tools**: Foundry, Remix
- **Testing & Security Tools**: Slither, Echidna, Aderyn

## Professional Development 🌱
- Security patterns in smart contract design
- Common vulnerabilities and exploits in smart contracts
- Advanced testing techniques for decentralized applications

## Projects 🛠️
Here’s a brief overview of some projects I've developed:
- **ERC20 Token**: A fully functional token adhering to the ERC20 standard.
- **Fund-Me Fundraiser Contract**: A decentralized platform for fundraising, leveraging smart contracts for transparent and secure transactions.
- **Smart Contract Lottery**: A decentralized lottery system implemented using Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Mood NFT**: A unique NFT project where users can mint NFTs reflecting their mood.
- **DeFi Stablecoin**: A stablecoin system designed to maintain a stable value through algorithmic mechanisms.
- **Simple DAO**: A basic decentralized autonomous organization allowing token holders to vote on community proposals.

## Smart Contract Audits 🔍
Additional audits are being conducted as I further advance the field of smart contract security through rigorous analysis and strategic enhancements.


1. **[Audit #1: PasswordStore]**
   - **Summary:** This audit highlighted significant vulnerabilities in the PasswordStore contract, including:
     - **[H-1]** Storing the password on-chain without encryption makes it visible to anyone.
     - **[H-2]** Lack of access control on the `setPassword` function allows any user to change the stored password.
     - **[I-1]** Incorrect natspec comment in the `getPassword` function signature.

   - **Impact & Mitigations:** 
     - **Severity:** High (for H-1 and H-2)
     - **Mitigations:** Implement encryption, add access controls, and correct documentation.

More audits will be added as I further establish my expertise in smart contract security and contribute leading-edge practices to the industry.
